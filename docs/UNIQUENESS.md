## 🚀 Your Unique Features (ChatGPT CAN'T Do These)

### 1. 💊 **Multi-Prescription Drug Interaction Checker**
**What it does:**
- Scans **multiple prescriptions simultaneously**
- Checks for **drug-drug interactions**

**Why it's unique:**

**Example:**
```
User uploads 3 prescriptions:
- Prescription 1: Warfarin

- Prescription 3: Ibuprofen

HealthScan detects:
⚠️ MAJOR: Warfarin + Aspirin = Increased bleeding risk
