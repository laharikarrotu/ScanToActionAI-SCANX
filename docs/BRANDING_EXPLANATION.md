# Branding Explanation

## Repository Name vs Product Name

**Repository Name**: `ScanToActionAI-SCANX`  
**Product Name**: `HealthScan`

### Why the Difference?

The repository was originally created as a **generic "Scan-to-Action" AI agent** framework (SCANX). During development, we pivoted to focus specifically on **healthcare use cases**, which led to the product being branded as **HealthScan**.

### Current Status

- **Repository**: Still named `ScanToActionAI-SCANX` for historical reasons and to maintain existing links/clones
- **Product**: Branded as **HealthScan** in all user-facing materials
- **Future**: We may rename the repository to `HealthScan` in a future major version

### Consistency

All documentation, README, and user-facing materials use **HealthScan** as the product name. The repository name is a technical detail that doesn't affect the user experience.
