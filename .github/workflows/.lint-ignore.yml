# This file documents that IDE linter warnings for GitHub Actions are false positives
# The actions referenced (actions/checkout@v4, actions/setup-python@v5, etc.) are valid
# and will work correctly when workflows run on GitHub.
#
# Common false positive warnings:
# - "Unable to resolve action" - IDE can't resolve GitHub Actions locally, but they work on GitHub
# - "Context access might be invalid" - IDE warnings about secrets context, but they're valid
#
# These warnings can be safely ignored. The workflows will execute correctly on GitHub.
